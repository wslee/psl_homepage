Description: Prevalent software engineering practices have significantly increased the complexity and bloat of today's software.
This in turn has led to decreased performance and increased security vulnerabilities. The Chisel project seeks to effectively counter this trend.

Unlike conventional programming tools, which seek to preserve the programâ€™s behavior, Chisel alters the program's behavior by removing unnecessary functionality.
The project is addressing a multitude of research problems such as how to specify the desired behavior, how to efficiently debloat programs in language-specific and language-independent ways, and what correctness guarantees to provide.

Chisel curently supports the C family of languages.
